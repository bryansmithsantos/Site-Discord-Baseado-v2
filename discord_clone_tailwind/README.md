# CodexLine Hub

CodexLine Hub is a modern chat application project aiming for a sleek, black and white aesthetic with elements of 3D design and transparency effects. This project is currently in the early stages of UI development using Tailwind CSS.

## Project Goals
- To create a visually unique and engaging user interface.
- Focus on a monochrome (black, white, and grays) color scheme.
- Incorporate subtle 3D elements and transparency for a modern feel.
- Develop a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Current Status
- Basic three-column layout implemented (Server List, Channel/User List, Main Chat Area).
- Initial Tailwind CSS v4 setup is complete.
- Basic monochrome theme applied.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files).**
    ```bash
    # If it were a git repo:
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd discord_clone_tailwind
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies.**
    Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Tailwind CSS build process.**
    This command will compile the `src/input.css` file into `public/output.css` and watch for changes.
    ```bash
    npm run build:css
    ```
4.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
    You can open the `discord_clone_tailwind/index.html` file directly in your web browser to see the current state of the UI.
